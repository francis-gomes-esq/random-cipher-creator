## Description

This JavaScript code helps you understand how passwords are generated. You can customise the passwords by choosing the length and types of characters. The code uses arrays to store different sets of characters like lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters, making the passwords diverse. It checks and validates user inputs to ensure a valid numeric password length within a specified range. The script randomly selects elements from arrays, adding a layer of security to the generated passwords. The "Generate" button triggers the password generation function, and user prompts allow customisation based on preferences. The code is well-organised, emphasising secure password practices for creating strong passwords. It integrates with HTML elements, enhancing user interaction for password generation and display.
